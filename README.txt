The purpose of this "Landing Page" project is to utlize my CSS skills learned up to this point to create a clone of a webpage provided by the Odin Project.
At this point in time, I have learned basic HTML and CSS (including flexbox) skills that I will be using to create this clone. Ideally, I will be able to use this 
page as a template for future web development projects.
